# E-commerce-Dashboard
Generate or use mock data to represent e-commerce metrics (e.g., sales, revenue, user activity). Utilise a charting library (such as Chart.js) to create visually appealing charts and graphs. Display at least three different types of charts (e.g., line chart, bar chart, pie chart) to represent various aspects of the data.
